## [Elaine Nsoesie](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/elaine-nsoesie/)

{{< figure src="/img/nsoesie.jpg" class="img-sponsor-c">}}

<b>Presentation Format</b>: "Keynote at the BAI Workshop"

<b>Title of Presentation</b>: "Using Digital Data and Technology to Improve Health"

<b>Abstract</b>: The global use of digital technologies has resulted in an unprecedented availability of digital data. If properly mined and filtered, these data can be combined with environmental, socioeconomic and epidemiologic data for understanding disease and health patterns, as well as the relationship between human behavior and disease spread. In this talk, Dr. Nsoesie will discuss the nascent field of digital epidemiology and present examples on the use of digital data (e.g., social media, Internet news, business and product reviews) and machine learning for monitoring infectious diseases, unsafe food products and risk factors for obesity.

<b>Bio</b>: Dr. Nsoesie is an Assistant Professor of Global Health at Boston University (BU) School of Public Health. She is also a BU Data Science Faculty Fellow as part of the BU Data Science Initiative at the Hariri Institute for Computing and a Data and Innovation Fellow at The Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI) in the Office of the President in Sierra Leone. Dr. Nsoesie applies data science methodologies to global health problems, using digital data and technology to improve health, particularly in the realm of surveillance of chronic and infectious diseases. She has worked with local public health departments in the United States and international organizations, such as UNICEF, Brazil Ministry of Health and the Surgo Foundation. She completed her postdoctoral studies at Harvard Medical School, and her PhD in Computational Epidemiology from the Genetics, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at Virginia Tech. She also has an MS in Statistics and a BS in Mathematics. Her work has been widely reported in news outlets and science magazines, including articles in Science, Smithsonian Magazine, Forbes, Washington Post, National Public Radio (NPR) and the BBC. She is the founder of Rethé - an initiative focused on providing scientific writing tools and resources to student communities in Africa in order to increase representation in scientific publications. She has written for NPR, The Conversation, Public Health Post and Quartz. Dr. Nsoesie was born and raised in Cameroon.

<b>Presentation Format</b>: "Keynote at the BAI Workshop"

<b>Title of Presentation</b>: "Creative Red Teaming: Approaches to Addressing Bias and Misuse in Machine Learning"

<b>Abstract</b>: Developing machine learning systems that address social biases and potential misuse requires creative approaches. Recently, we have seen the development of models that contain substantial social biases, as well as models ripe for potential misuse in relation to neural disinformation. In this lecture, I examine how creative technologists, researchers in the digital humanities, and machine learning researchers can work together to develop more robust defenses. I discuss how a deep understanding of historical context can inform current socio-political impacts of neural disinformation and bias in machine learning models. I then highlight research that operationalizes these models, and discuss how we might foster critical interactions between research fields to combat bias and misuse moving forward.

<b>Bio</b>: Matthew Kenney is a researcher, developer, and designer. His work centers on the intersection of technology, design, and critical software development. He is a researcher at Duke University in Computational Media Arts and Cultures, where he teaches classes on machine learning, software development and interaction design. His research areas include machine learning, race, society and information studies. He holds a Bachelor’s of Science from Cornell University and a Masters in New Media from Penn State University.
